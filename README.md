Pain point Inaccurate medical coding costs $7.8B in the US
    For fiscal year (FY) 2022, the CERT program estimated that the improper payment
    rate for Medicare FFS was 6.3%, or $31 billion. This includes improper payments due
    to medical coding errors, as well as other types of errors, such as ineligible services
    and duplicate payments.
    Medical coding errors are a major contributor to improper Medicare payments. A 2020
    report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that medical coding
    errors accounted for approximately 25% of Medicare improper payments in FY 2018.

Many benefits to getting medical coding right
Improved patient care
○Accurate medical coding ensures that patients receive the correct treatment and that their medical
history is accurately documented.
○This can lead to better health outcomes and reduced risk of errors.
  ●Increased efficiency
  ○Correct medical coding helps healthcare providers to process claims more efficiently and accurately.
  ○This can lead to faster reimbursement and improved cash flow.
  ●Reduced fraud
○Accurate medical coding helps to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims, which can save healthcare
providers and insurers money.
  ●Improved compliance
  ○Correct medical coding helps healthcare providers to comply with government regulations.
  ○This can avoid costly fines and penalties.
